Tabbycat is a draw tabulation system for British Parliamentary and a variety of two-team formats. It was used at Australs 2010 and 2012‚Äì2019, EUDC 2018, WUDC 2019‚Äì2020 and many other tournaments of all sizes and formats. To see an example of a post-tournament website, have a look at the [WUDC 2020 tab website](https://wudc2020.herokuapp.com).

**Want to try it out?** The best way to trial Tabbycat is just to launch a new site, as described [below](#%EF%B8%8F-installation)). It takes just a few clicks, requires no technical background, and you can always deploy a fresh copy when you're ready to run your tournament.

## üîç Features

- Deployable to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for an easy, fast, and free setup
- Enter data from multiple computers simultaneously and (optionally) display results, draws, and other information online
- Collect ballots and feedback online, or from printed forms customised for each round ( adjudicator feedback questions and rankings [are configurable](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/adjudicator-feedback.html))
- Automated adjudicator allocations based on adjudicator ranking, debate priority, and conflicts/clashes
- A drag and drop interface for adjudicator allocation that displays conflicts alongside break liveness and gender/regional/language balance considerations
- A responsive interface that adapts to suit large screens, laptops, tablets, and phones
- Support for British Parliamentary (EUDC/WUDC), Australs, NZ Easters, Australian Easters, Joynt Scroll, UADC, and WSDC rule sets as well as configurable [draw generation rules](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/draw-generation.html) and [team standings rules](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/standings-rules.html)

## üìñ Documentation

Our user guide is at [tabbycat.readthedocs.io](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/).

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Installation

Tabbycat can be deployed in a number of ways. While you can set it up to [run on your own computer](https://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/local.html) most users will want to run it as a website.

[Calico](https://calicotab.com/) is a managed hosting service run by one of Tabbycat's developers. For a flat fee, it will host tab websites, automatically manage their setup and performance, and provide ongoing access to the released tab. Click this button to deploy to Calico:

[![Deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gist/tienne-B/fc04ecd3c11a38424b642b4bba60e8d9/raw/b2c71d7d6a0d368d3e9dfd8002af729d155ad09b/calicodeploy.svg)](https://calicotab.com/tournaments/new/)

Tabbycat is **currently unavailable as a 1-click installation** on the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/vijaturulyte/tabbycat) web platform. If you are unable to use Calico, we suggest [creating a local installation](https://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/local.html). We hope to address this issue or [develop an alternate installation method](https://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/feature-render/index.html) in a future version of Tabbycat.
